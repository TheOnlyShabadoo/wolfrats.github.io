*The following report details two sessions on 3/14/21 and 3/21/21.*

An indescribable partnership: David Adams, a disgruntled worker with debts to pay; and Craig Boone, an ex-Union operative with a haunted conscience. Together they struck out D15 Gateway, a station in the Long Rim on the edge of the infamous Scyllan Gap. Crushed by their bills and their pasts, they turned to bounty hunting to stay alive. Their latest gig was a deal for none other than the Smith-Shimano corp. A bounty was posted for a fugitive who had stolen key data from a Smith-Shimano station, and Adams and Boone brought them in.

In doing so, they made contact with a shadowy broker known only as “Jorge” (pronounced “George”), who deals in data and mixed drinks. His hole-in-the-wall (which apparently has no name) proved to be invaluable to the duo as they set out on their next bounty.

Adams and Boone picked up a hit on a lancer known as “Fry Far-he-Sails” posted by an anonymous group. With nothing to go on, they went to Jorge’s. 

Adams gave the very clever covert sign used for making deals. 

“I’ll have a whiskey on the rocks.” 

Jorge nodded.

Boone slipped the barkeep the target’s name, and received a disc containing info scrubbed from the comm. channels of a local pirate gang, the Bloodkrakes.
“Devil Town, for sure. Closing in on the bastard.”

With this lead, the duo had almost everything they needed. All that was left to do was a little reconnaissance and some clever disguises.

Boone caught wind that some Bloodkrakes had been seen gearing up near the Boneyard. Meanwhile, Adams painted over his mech in a royal purple, the color of a notorious Baron House mercenary company. His goal: (?).

The stage was set. The air was right. It was time to hunt.

A lift brought them to the cold, silent docks of the Boneyard. A few scrappers met their eyes as they left the lift, but all refused to talk. The hunters were out of leads, when a bright flash caught their eye. Fearing they would lose their mark, they ran out to the end of a bridge where a decaying carrier ship was erupting with flashes of gunfire.

In they charged, weaving through old reactors and across weathered decks, the stars peeking in through the rotting corpse of the ship.
Firefight. Two Bloodkrakes, ready to draw blood to protect their prize. One exploded from a blast by Adams, the other took a right hook from Boone before Adams sent it flying into corrosive acid where it, too, exploded.

All they had to do now was bring in their bounty. Far Far-he-Sails hiding away in the ship’s navigation deck, begged for life. He made a counter-offer. “You let me go, and you can have my body--my mech.”

Reluctant but intrigued, the duo debated. Fry knew an uncanny amount about their lives, and implored them to look beyond the lives of fear that they had fallen into.
Finally they agreed, and watched as Fry ascended into a craft the likes of which they’d never seen. They thought themselves marks when only silence followed, but just as they began to doubt the husk of Fry’s mech came floating back.

“Should we hand in the bounty? Or sell this mech on the market?” 

They chose the former, after which a cowled man with robotic arms arrived on a sleek craft to collect what was theirs. The mech, and the money, traded hands.

Halfway to the lift, Adams and Boone got a message on their terminals. “Fuck you.” The meaning was clear.

Bounty hunting is not a trade conducive to mercy. What will the duo do with their new gains and, perhaps, more than a few new enemies?
